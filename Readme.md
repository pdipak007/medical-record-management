# **Medical Record Management Smart Contract**

## **Introduction**

The **Medical Record Management** smart contract is a decentralized application built on the **Aptos blockchain** using the **Move** language. This contract allows patients to securely create and store medical records on the blockchain, granting access to authorized healthcare providers. The data is represented as a hash (data hash), ensuring privacy and security while providing patients with full control over who can access their medical information.

This smart contract aims to address issues of data privacy, security, and transparency in the healthcare industry by enabling patients to manage their health records in a decentralized, tamper-proof manner.

## **Vision of the Project**

The vision of the **Medical Record Management** project is to empower individuals by giving them complete control over their medical data. The project seeks to:
- **Decentralize healthcare record management**, allowing patients to store and manage their medical data securely on the blockchain.
- Enable **secure access control**, where patients can grant and revoke access to healthcare providers, ensuring privacy and data security.
- Create a **trustworthy, immutable system** where medical data cannot be altered or deleted without the patient’s consent, fostering transparency and reducing fraud in the healthcare industry.

## **Future Goals of the Project**

As the **Medical Record Management** project evolves, the following future goals are envisioned:

1. **Multi-Record Support**: Expand the system to support multiple medical records for each patient, allowing a range of data types (e.g., prescriptions, medical history, lab reports).
2. **Revoke Access**: Add functionality to allow patients to revoke or modify the access granted to healthcare providers.
3. **Emergency Access**: Implement a mechanism for emergency access where healthcare providers can access medical records in critical situations, with proper logging and patient consent tracking.
4. **Data Encryption**: Enhance the security of the medical record data with encryption methods, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed even when stored on the blockchain.
5. **Integration with Healthcare Providers**: Integrate this system with existing healthcare systems, allowing easy data exchange between the blockchain-based records and hospital management systems.

## **Deployed Address of the Project**

The **Medical Record Management** smart contract is deployed on the **Aptos blockchain**. You can interact with the deployed contract using the following address:

```Tx Hash:-
0x17ebc95c95fef7cd7653ba77ab31dda686c2cef5502751db9328d51213c349a5
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to interact with the contract and that you are using the correct address for your network.

## **How to Interact with the Contract**

### **1. Create a Medical Record:**
Patients can create a new medical record by calling the `create_record` function, providing the hash of the medical record data.

Example:
```move
MyModule::MedicalRecordManagement::create_record(&patient_signer, b"hash_of_record");
```

### **2. Grant Access to a Healthcare Provider:**
Patients can grant access to a healthcare provider by calling the `grant_access` function, providing the provider's address.

Example:
```move
MyModule::MedicalRecordManagement::grant_access(&patient_signer, @0x123456789);
```
